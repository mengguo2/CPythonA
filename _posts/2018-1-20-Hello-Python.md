## Hello Python!
Let's begin going over some essential Python types!

### integer (int)
Integers are whole numbers that you can do math with.
```python
aint = 1
aint2 = aint + 2
print(aint2)
```
Output:
```python
3
```

### float (float)
Floats are decimal values that you can do math with.
```python
afloat = 1.25
```
If you add an integer with a float, let's see what happens!
```python
afloat = 1.25
aafloat = afloat + 2
print(aafloat)
```
Output:
```python
3.25
```

### string (str)
A string is text such as titles ("2018 Budget"), column names ("Revenue", "expenses"), etc.

You can use quotation marks or apostrophes to define strings as long as you open and close each one!
```python
title = '2018 Budget'
column_name = "Revenue"
column_name2 = "expenses"
print(title, column_name, column_name2)
```
Output:
```python
2018 Budget, Revenue, expenses
```

### list (list)
Lists are ...
```python
alist = []
```
If you add an integer with a float, let's see what happens!
```python
afloat = 1.25
aafloat = afloat + 2
print(aafloat)
```
Output:
```python
3.25
```

### tuple (tuple)
Floats are decimal values that you can do math with.
```python
afloat = 1.25
```
If you add an integer with a float, let's see what happens!
```python
afloat = 1.25
aafloat = afloat + 2
print(aafloat)
```
Output:
```python
3.25
```

### dictionary (dict)
Floats are decimal values that you can do math with.
```python
afloat = 1.25
```
If you add an integer with a float, let's see what happens!
```python
afloat = 1.25
aafloat = afloat + 2
print(aafloat)
```
Output:
```python
3.25
```
